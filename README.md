### Carpe diem. Make your lives extraordinary.

> I work in `Artificial Intelligence`, more specifically in `Multi-agent Systems` and `Software Engineering`, but I have ventured into the areas of `Robotics`, `Ubiquitous Computing`, and the `Internet of Things`. In the management area, I work in technology dissemination (and currently social media), technological innovation, entrepreneurship, and Information Technology Governance and process mapping. 

- Iâ€™m currently working on [`multi-agent-system`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_system) [`embedded-system`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system) [`modeling-language`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modeling_language#:~:text=A%20modeling%20language%20is%20any,in%20the%20structure%20Programing%20language.) [`metamodel`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamodeling#:~:text=%22Metamodeling%22%20is%20the%20construction%20of,metamodels%20to%20represent%20that%20behavior.)
